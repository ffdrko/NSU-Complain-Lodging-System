# NSU-Complain-Lodging-System
This is based on our project of the course 'Software Engineering' assigned by our instructor. Here students, faculty, administration employee and helping staff can complain about any particular person for not doing their job properly and the supervisor of that person can review the complain. There will also be a system admin who has admin access to database and can perform any action on behalf of any other user.
